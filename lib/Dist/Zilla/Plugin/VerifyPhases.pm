=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::VerifyPhases - Compare data and files at different phases of the distribution build process

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>, as the last plugin loaded:

    [VerifyPhases]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin runs in multiple L<Dist::Zilla> phases to check what actions have
taken place so far.  Its intent is to find any plugins that are performing
actions outside the appropriate phase, so they can be fixed.

Running at the end of the C<-FileGatherer> phase, it verifies that the
distribution's metadata has not yet been calculated (as it usually depends on
knowing the full manifest of files in the distribution).

It runs at the C<-FileMunger> and C<-AfterBuild> phases to record the state
of files after they have been munged, and again at the end of the build
process.  Any files that have had their names or content changed are flagged.

Currently, L<FromCode|Dist::Zilla::File::FromCode> files are not checked for
content, as interesting side effects can occur if their content subs are run
before all content is available (for example, other lazy builders can run too
early, resulting in incomplete or missing data).
